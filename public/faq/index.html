      <section id="appdf">
        <legend>AppDF - Application Description File</legend>
        <h4 class="question">What is the current project status?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          <ul>
          <li>The current version of <a href="/appdf/specification/">AppDF specification</a> is 1.0.</li>
          <li>Two appstores - <a href="http://apps.opera.com/">Opera Mobile Store</a> and <a href="http://store.yandex.com/">Yandex.Store</a> - have AppDF publishing support in the beta stage.</li>
          <li>Several more appstores have committed to supporting AppDF and are now working on implementation.</li>
          <li><a href="/editor/">AppDF Editor</a> is ready.</li>
          <li>A command line tool for submitting AppDF to appstores is in beta.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">Where can I submit AppDF files?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          You can currently submit them to <a href="http://apps.opera.com/">Opera Mobile Store</a> and <a href="http://store.yandex.com/">Yandex.Store</a>. Both have AppDF format support on their developer portals. Several other appstores are working on AppDF implementation.
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">How can I create AppDF file?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          You can either follow <a href="/appdf/specification/">AppDF specification</a> or use <a href="/editor/">AppDF Editor</a>.
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">Can I create one AppDF for all stores, including Google Play?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          Yes, you can. When we created AppDF specification, we carefully checked all the existing Android appstores to make sure AppDF format includes all the necessary information. AppDF also supports store-specific sections, so you can add custom information for individual appstores.
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">How can you match categories from different appstores?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          [Answer to be supplied soon.]
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">What is the difference between AppDF and mobile app aggregators?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          AppDF is a format that lets developers upload single distribution files directly to multiple appstores. In other words, the AppDF approach cuts out the middle man, enabling app developers to publish their apps directly to appstores rather than to an aggregator.
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">Which Android appstores support the AppDF format?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          CodeNGO, Opera Mobile Store, SlideME and Yandex.Store already support submissions using AppDF. Appland and Aptoide are working on integrating support.
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">I am an Android appstore. How can I support AppDF format?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          [Answer to be supplied soon.]
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">What if I want to define different categories for different appstores?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          [Answer to be supplied soon.]
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">How can I describe In-App Purchases in AppDF?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          Right now, AppDF does not support in-app purchases. This is because it is currently very difficult to create one APK file to support in-app billing API for different appstores. We plan to support in-app purchases in the next version of AppDF. It will be aligned with the <a href="/openiab/">OpenIAB</a> library, facilitating the creation of an APK file that supports in-app billing for all the existing appstores.
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">What should I do if I have a proposal for the next version of AppDF specification?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          The best thing to do is join the mailing list, and describe the motivation (e.g. use cases) and optionally the proposal itself. You can also submit a pull request on GitHub.

      <section id="openiab">
       <legend>OpenIAB - Open In-App Billing</legend>
        <h4 class="question">What is current project status?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          OpenIAB library is currently under development. We have finished a sample game that supports in-app billing for four different stores (Google Play, Amazon AppStore, Samsung Apps and SK T-Store) and are now working on splitting in-app purchase code in a separate library. We will try to keep its interface as close to Google Play IAB API as possible. We have simultaneously starting work on OpenIAB API that other stores could implement to support all the apps and games that use OpenIAB Lib. <a href="/contribute/#joinopeniab">Join us</a> to develop OpenIAB together. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">Does OpenIAB support mobile operator billing?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          This question is based on a misunderstanding. All payments are processed directly by each appstore. There is no middle man standing between app developers and appstores. OpenIAB will not process payments for the appstores. It is simply an API enabling apps to communicate with appstores to request in-app billing and get a response.
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">What is the difference between OpenIAB Lib and OpenIAB API?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          OpenIAB Lib is a library that wraps in-app billing APIs of several appstores. All you need to do is integrate it once, and your app will support in-app billing for all these stores. OpenIAB API is yet another in-app billing API that appstores can implement. OpenIAB API is integrated into OpenIAB Lib as one of the supported APIs. By implementing OpenIAB API, the appstores will automatically support any app that uses OpenIAB Lib.
        </p>

        <h4 class="question">What is the source code license?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          The source code of the OpenIAB library and the samples is available under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0:<br>
          <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</a>

      <section id="general">
        <legend>General OPF Questions</legend>
        <h4 class="question">Who is standing behind OPF?</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          Yandex and Opera have provided resources to make it happen, and contributors to OnePF have provided actual work. Not to forget the stores that have implemented or a working on support for AppDF.
        </p>
    
        <h4 class="question">How are decisions about the next version of the standards made</h4>
        <p class="answer">
          So far we haven't got a formal charter, but we are working on one. Our goal is that "rough consensus and running code" are the main guidance.
